# agent66 — V2 MIGRATION PLAN (stub)

_This placeholder will be replaced after a dedicated code scan of the **agent66** repository._

## Next steps
- [ ] Run inventory and manifest inspection for `agent66`
- [ ] Confirm runtimes (Node / Python), build & test commands, and major components
- [ ] Define Docker Compose needs (if any) and CI workflows
- [ ] Add `.env.example`, `.editorconfig`, and shared pre-commit hooks

Once the scan is complete, this stub will be expanded into a full migration plan aligned with the portfolio-wide V2 baseline.
